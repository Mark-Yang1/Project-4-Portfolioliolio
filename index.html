            <p>My name is Mark Yang, and, as of writing this, I am a student at CART. I am currently taking the Web Application Development class. This year, I’ve learned a significant amount about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve created multiple websites from scratch using Visual Studio Code, and use Github to manage projects (including this one). If you would like to view my previous projects, you can find them below.</p>

                        <h3>DelveHomes</h3>
                        <p>DelveHomes was a project that me and my partner Mason Peters did as a part of our web development class. We would create a website by hand for a fictitious home builder company. It was the first time that I would build a multi-page website, and it was the first time I used Github. First, we used Figma to create a layout for the pages, and created all the written content that would be in the slide. Then we both used Visual Studio Code to program the HTML and CSS, and we also used an extension to Visual Studio Code called “Live Server” which helped us view the changes we made to the code in real time. Building the site was quite difficult, and much of our code was inefficient and quite hard to work with, but nonetheless, me and my partner persevered and created a functional website.</p>

                        <h3>Phishing Awareness</h3>
                        <p>On this project, my peers coded the website while I supervised and guided them to create my website. We created a website to spread awareness about phishing scams. Just like in my previous project, we would first start by creating a Figma layout for the pages, and then write the written parts of the website. Then, everyday from then I would work with new people and have them try to pick up where the last person had left off. Not only that, but everybody had varying levels of skill in either HTML or CSS, which complicated the coding process even more. To combat this, I encouraged my peers to work with what they were most comfortable with, to prevent them from making below-average quality work. I also worked on other peoples’ various websites, and was guided into creating elements and stylizing them to fit the vision of my supervisor.</p>

                        <h3>Coursera</h3>
                        <p>After learning and applying HTML and CSS, I would then learn JavaScript from a Courseera course. I learned the basics of JavaScript, such as how to store data with variables, what kinds of data types there are (numbers, strings, and booleans), and how operators work. After that, I would learn how to use statements such as loops, console logs, and defining variables. The course made me use what I learned in small coding assignments to try and create a solution to a given prompt, which helped me get more comfortable with coding JavaScript. Further into the course, it would test me on what a given statement, or bunch of statements do. There were many quizzes that I had to do too, but they weren’t very difficult. In the end, I completed all of my assignments and passed the course with a 95.33% accuracy.</p>

                        <h3>Tariff Monopoly</h3>
                        <p>This was my most recent project that I had completed, and the first one where I would use JavaScript to create complicated algorithms. Me and 2 other classmates worked together to recreate the game “Monopoly” in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, as you can see, we also added a twist. There would be taxes. We came up with this idea on a whim, and, after creating the Figma layout and flowchart for the algorithm on Lucidchart, we had come to the realization that Monopoly has lots of variables at play, and would be quite difficult to recreate. Still, we continued with our heads high, and we started coding. Initially I struggled with coding an efficient and effective way to start the game. Despite that, all 3 of us learned how to use JavaScript to work with multiple variables, arrays, and objects, and were still quite happy with what we had, even if it was unfinished.</p>
